These are CSE Projects for Different Subjects
1. Neural Networks: (CSE-5368)
   This Subject deals with Theoretical principles of neurocomputing. Learning algorithms, information capacity, and mapping properties of feedforward and recurrent          networks. 
   Different neural network models will be implemented and their practical applications discussed.
   a) Single Layer Neural Network: Implementing Model and Training
   b) Practice with different learning rules. Note that the neural network in this assignment may be used for regression or classification.
   c) create multi-layer neural networks using Tensorflow (without using Keras).

2. DBMS MODELS AND IMPLEMENTATION: Mongodb implementation
   This project explains on using MongoDB as an example of a document-oriented NOSQL system, and how data is stored and queried in such a system. It also helps in   understanding the difference between storing data in a flat (relational) format versus in a document (complex object) JSON or XML format.   
3. DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS: (CSE-5311) 
   Sorting Algorithm is the algorithm in which elements are arrange in certain order, in order of numeric digits, lexicographical order.
   Sorting Algorithms included in this project are as follows:
   • Selection Sort
   • Insertion Sort
   • Bubble Sort
   • Merge Sort
   • Heap Sort
   • Quick Sort
   • Quick Sort - Using 3 medians
