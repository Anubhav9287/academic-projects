These are CSE Projects for Different Subjects
### 1. Neural Networks: (CSE-5368)
  This Subject deals with Theoretical principles of neurocomputing. Learning algorithms, information capacity, and mapping properties of feedforward and recurrent networks.
  Different neural network models will be implemented and their practical applications discussed.
   - a) Single Layer Neural Network: Implementing Model and Training
   - b) Practice with different learning rules. Note that the neural network in this assignment may be used - for regression or classification.
   - c) create multi-layer neural networks using Tensorflow (without using Keras).

### 2. DBMS MODELS AND IMPLEMENTATION: Mongodb implementation
  This project explains on using MongoDB as an example of a document-oriented NOSQL system, and how data is stored and queried in such a system. It also helps in understanding the difference between storing data in a flat (relational) format versus in a document (complex object) JSON or XML format.   
### 3. DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS: (CSE-5311) 
  Sorting Algorithm is the algorithm in which elements are arrange in certain order, in order of numeric digits, lexicographical order.
  Sorting Algorithms included in this project are as follows:
 - • Selection Sort
 - • Insertion Sort
   - • Bubble Sort
   - • Merge Sort
   - • Heap Sort
   - • Quick Sort
   - • Quick Sort - Using 3 medians
### 4. WEB DATA MANAGEMENT: CSE-5335
  This is a full stack project for housing system. (Laravel, PHP)
   The purpose of this project is to create a site which manages, controls and monitors a subdivision of buildings where each building has several apartments, and each apartment has a responsible contact/owner. The site provides access to three dashboards which  work  on  three  different  levels  i.e.,  Subdivision,  Building  and  Apartment. Authorized  respective  persons  can  generate  the  corresponding  report  of  apartment, building  or  subdivision  for their  service  consumption.  The  portal  not  only  helps  the person monitor their service consumption but also provides a detailed report (including public and private services).
  There live chat option given to user and owers to chat.
