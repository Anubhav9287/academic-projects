These are CSE Projects for Different Subjects
1. Neural Networks: (CSE-5368)
   This Subject deals with Theoretical principles of neurocomputing. Learning algorithms, information capacity, and mapping properties of feedforward and recurrent networks. 
   Different neural network models will be implemented and their practical applications discussed.
   a) Single Layer Neural Network: Implementing Model and Training
   b) Practice with different learning rules. Note that the neural network in this assignment may be used for regression or classification.
   c) create multi-layer neural networks using Tensorflow (without using Keras).
